# Introduction

This project uses the built-in **AirPassengers** dataset, which records monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. The dataset exhibits a clear upward trend and strong seasonal patterns, making it an ideal candidate for forecasting analysis. In this report, we compare three different forecasting approaches:

- **ARIMA**: Automatically identifies optimal parameters to model trends and autocorrelations.
- **ETS**: Decomposes the series into error, trend, and seasonal components for clear interpretability.
- **TBATS**: Utilizes trigonometric representations and transformations to handle complex seasonality and non-linear trends.

Each modelâ€™s detailed analysis is provided in its respective child document, enabling a modular workflow that facilitates collaborative development and maintenance.

# Data Overview

The **AirPassengers** dataset contains monthly totals of international airline passengers over a 12-year period. Its combination of an upward trend and seasonal fluctuations presents a robust challenge for forecasting methods, making it a common benchmark in time series analysis.

# Model Comparison and Discussion
- ARIMA automatically identifies parameters that capture both trend and autocorrelation.
- ETS explicitly decomposes the time series, making it easier to understand the underlying level, trend, and seasonal components.
- TBATS offers flexibility when dealing with complex seasonal patterns or subtle non-linear behaviors.

The forecasts generated by each model provide complementary insights into future passenger numbers. The choice of model may ultimately depend on factors such as forecasting horizon, interpretability, and the specific nuances present in the data.

# Conclusion

Our analysis of the **AirPassengers** data using ARIMA, ETS, and TBATS models demonstrates that each approach has its own strengths. ARIMA effectively handles autocorrelation, ETS offers a clear component-based decomposition, and TBATS is well-suited for complex seasonal patterns. Future work might include cross-validation for forecast accuracy or even combining model forecasts to further improve performance.
